# Agent Startup Instructions (Project Root)

1. Read `PROJECT_AGENT_CONTEXT.md` before making any change.
2. Treat `PROJECT_AGENT_CONTEXT.md` as the persistent handoff log and update it after each user request.
3. Keep `README.md`, root Windows `.cmd` helpers, and mobile/build instructions synchronized.
